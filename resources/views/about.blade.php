{{--                                <p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">Enter CSS grid: which lets you place an item exactly where you want it, both vertically and horizontally. Sounds simple, but the reality is that it unlocks a level of expressive freedom and control that previously only print could give us.&nbsp;</p>--}}
{{--                                <p>Still, IE usage probably isn’t significant enough to fully explain the lack of grid adoption. So, consider that the stats cited above focus on&nbsp;<em>page views</em>, not&nbsp;<em>pages</em>. That means that it’s the lack of adoption of grid by&nbsp;<em>major</em>&nbsp;websites that more likely explains grid’s seemingly poor performance to date.&nbsp;</p>--}}
